Here are some good tutorials/articles/blogs that I found useful in my study and programming.

## Web Dev
**[[SITE]](https://www.bezkoder.com/)** Full stack web dev reference site. It has code example for any combo you want, e.g. Springboot+React, Django+Vue... Not comprehensive tutorials but definitely sufficient to create a runnable tech stack rapidly. I found this especially useful when setting things up during the initialization phrase where you try to connect frontend/backend/DB/Middlewares and test their collaboration. 


**[[ARTICLE]](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-exactly-is-client-side-rendering-and-hows-it-different-from-server-side-rendering-bd5c786b340d/)** Client-side rendering VS server-side rendering


<br>


## Machine Learning/Data
**[[ARTICLE](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/bias-variance-tradeoff-explained-fa2bc28174c4)]** An in-depth explanation about bias and variance.


**[[ARTICLE](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/batch-normalization/)]** Importance of normalising data in neural networks.Â 


**[[TUTORIAL]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=1)** The best series of introductory videos for neural networks. Mainly talked about MLP.


**[[COURSE](https://www.youtube.com/@firstprinciplesofcomputerv3258)]** University of Columbia's full *Computer Vision* course. Exceptionally well structured and delivered. Legendary professor. 


**[[ARTICLE](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)]** Feature visualization and how convolutional neural network learns


**[[SITE](https://convnetplayground.fastforwardlabs.com/#/models)]** A pre-trained CNN playground. You can use different pre-trained CNN as feature extractors. Then use extracted embeddings to perform Sementic Search - find another similar image within a dataset. There are many adjustable parameters, including datasets, pre-trained CNN, which layer you want to use, and distance metrics. Pretty fun to play around to see the effect of using different pre-trained CNN layers to extract features.

## Computer Networks


**[[TUTORIAL]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMcmspNpkOw&list=PLMLm7-g0V0kdRIhd-qOtDSfG1tNAaQCBz&index=1&t=10s)** Good computer network tutorials. It might be person-to-person-based but I really like the presentation and speaking style of this professor.


**[[ARTICLE]](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when)** What happens when you access a website? Explain all OSI layers' behaviour from the physical layer to the application layer.


**[[SITE]](https://www2.tkn.tu-berlin.de/teaching/rn/animations/gbn_sr/)** Visualise and let you play with TCP's retransmission. Helpful to the exam.

## Artifical Intelligence (The subject)
AI has really spread out these days. People tend to call all kinds of stuff "AI": object detection, language models, robots. In university course design, AI usually means the traditional sense kind, which generally not "data-based". For example, advanced search algorithms, game AI (heuristic based), planning, reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, Markov models, etc. Maybe they should be called "non data-based AI", differ from things done with neural networks and large training datasets. 

**[[TUTORIAL]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U&list=PL2bg-mBy9Lqi7Q14cOqOK7zVvR6Jfk4nA&index=4)** This professor is truly a legend. Helped me so much for the exam. He has a remarkable ability to explain complex algorithms, taking you through each step with clarity and precision. You can find step-by-step demo for things like search algorthims, MCTS, constrain-satisfication. 

**[[SITE]](https://raphsilva.github.io/utilities/minimax_simulator/#)** Minimax and alpha-beta pruning simulator. For the exam purpose, randomly make some trees by yourself and perform the pruning and backpropagations to practice. 

**[[COURSE]](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp23/)** Berkeley's *Artificial Intelligence* course. 


<br>


## Distributed/Cloud
**[[COURSE]](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html)** MIT's *Distributed Systems*. Most reputable yet challenging Distributed System course. It introduces a new web middleware/DB/tech every module. But heavily depends on your self-learning skills, as you need to read the original papers before watching the lectures. If you also feel sad taking Unimelb's ill-designed trash course COMP90015 (Distributed Systems) that 40% of the contents overlap with COMP30023, 60% of the contents are too high-level and old AF, then consider self-studying this by yourself.

<br>

## Cryptography
**[[TUTORIAL]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9bTzjy4SCg)** Tutorial for finite field (Galois field). This channel also has many good math tutorials. The videos are remarkably precise and logical, cutting straight to the heart of the topic without any superfluous content. And it will give motivation on why we studying a certain topic. This video is especially helpful if you are a Unimelb student taking COMP90043 (Crytography and Security). The subject content on the finite field part is so ill-designed. The lecture slides are nothing but a stacking of formula with no connections. Plus if your lecturer is Udaya then... Other than this, this subject's syllabus is ok. 

**[[COURSE]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRgJU3EsOYDTW7m6SUmW6kII)** *Crytography and Network Security* full course on youtube. Might be helpful to your COMP90043 (Crytography and Security) study. But I personally find the suggested textbook (*Crytography and Network Security - William Stallings*) more useful for this subject. The subject syllabus follows the textbook exactly so if you didn't understand anything just refer to the textbook.
