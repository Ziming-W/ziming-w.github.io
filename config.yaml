    content: |-
      I am a Master of Information Technology student with the specialization of Distributed Computing at the University of Melbourne. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor of Science - Computing and Software Systems degree with a First-Class Honour Distinction (H1) at the same institution.
      
      I have a keen interest in the fields of backend web development, system architecture, distributed/cloud computing, and machine learning/AI. I have experiences in several backend web frameworks including Spring Boot, Django, and Node.js. I also possess essential frontend skills such as HTML/CSS/JS. I chose distributed computing as my specialization for my master's course, in order to further enhance my backend development and system architecture skills. 

      In addition, I have a distinct skill set in data wrangling and machine learning. I took multiple relevant elective subjects at Unimelb including data processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, probability theory, computer vision and NLP (planned). These courses have equipped me with valuable expertise in data manipulation and predictive modeling, enabling me to contribute to data-driven solutions that enhance the intelligence of applications.
